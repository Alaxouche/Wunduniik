    "description": "This modlist is an heavy \u002B1900 mods list based on my personnal preferences. It improves almost everything from the vanilla game to make it looks more like a 2023 game than a 2011 game. Keep in mind that the list is more like a vanilla rework than a list adding new quests, new lands... Wunduniik is a draconic word meaning \u0022Traveler\u0022. I chose this one as I think that when you travel, you discover new cultures, architectures... things can look a lot different. I think this modlist will provide you the same feeling, because you will almost discover a new game.",
