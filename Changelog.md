## Overview of the update:
Many bugs have been fixed, the gameplay and combats is improved, more complex and complicated with new bash features, a lot of new spells, Addons of tree skills for Amadant. The UI has been a bit improved, new icons added, the loot contextual menu now only opens outside of combat to keep the screen clean during the gameplay. A few visual improvements also have been made, especially in small clutter things.
This update also focuses a lot on the Sounds. Many mods by Satafinix have been added and updated, and compatibility patches for other mods added.
This version should be a lot more stable and enjoyable than the previous one, with almost no performance loss.
